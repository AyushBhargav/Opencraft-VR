# Opencraft-VR
My academic project for Mobile App Development Lab. It is basically a minecraft clone which you can play with google cardboard.

## Features
1. Infinite world creation like one in Minecraft. I used perlin noise for this.
2. Mining and placing "blocks" in the world. Pretty easy stuff.
3. Optimised for low resource phones (like Mine :happy:) with the help of hashing and not rendering the blocks which are not located in immediately visible area.
4. Cave Generation.
5. Cloud Generation.
6. Day-night cycle.
7. Forest Generation.
8. Mountain Generation.
9. Inventory UI. Again pretty easy stuff.
10. Google Cardboard Support.

**Have Fun!**
